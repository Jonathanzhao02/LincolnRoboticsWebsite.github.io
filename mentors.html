					<p>This other mentorman is sort of okay. Not as good as the first mentorman, who is extremely good at what he does. He's also a man. Also no sexism. He's just a man.</p>

					<p>This is the final mentorman. She is actually not a man, and brings some diversity into our robotics program. Just kidding, he's also a man, and also an extremely good mentor. No sexism tho.</p>
